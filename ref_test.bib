	abstract = {To carry out required aid operations efficiently and effectively after an occurrence of a disaster such as an earthquake, emergency control centers must determine the effect of disasters precisely and and in a timely manner. Different kinds of data-gathering techniques can be used to collect data from disaster areas, such as sensors, cameras, and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Furthermore, data-fusion techniques can be adopted to combine the data gathered from different sources to enhance the situation awareness. Recent research and development activities on advanced air mobility (AAM) and related unmanned aerial systems (UASs) provide new opportunities. Unfortunately, designing these systems for disaster situation analysis is a challenging task due to the topological complexity of urban areas, and multiplicity and variability of the available data sources. Although there are a considerable number of research publications on data fusion, almost none of them deal with estimating the optimal set of heterogeneous data sources that provide the best effectiveness and efficiency value in determining the effect of disasters. Moreover, existing publications are generally problem- and system-specific. This article proposes a model-based novel analysis and synthesis framework to determine the optimal data fusion set among possibly many alternatives, before expensive implementation and installation activities are carried out.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a theoretical model of situation awareness based on its role in dynamic human decision making in a variety of domains. Situation awareness is presented as a predominant concern in system operation, based on a descriptive view of decision making. The relationship between situation awareness and numerous individual and environmental factors is explored. Among these factors, attention and working memory are presented as critical factors limiting operators from acquiring and interpreting information from the environment to form situation awareness, and mental models and goal-directed behavior are hypothesized as important mechanisms for overcoming these limits. The impact of design features, workload, stress, system complexity, and automation on operator situation awareness is addressed, and a taxonomy of errors in situation awareness is introduced, based on the model presented. The model is used to generate design implications for enhancing operator situation awareness and future directions for situation awareness research.},

	doi = {10.1109/MAES.2020.3043072},
	abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI), owing to recent breakthroughs in deep learning, has revolutionized applications and services in almost all technology domains including aerospace. AI and deep learning rely on huge amounts of training data that are mostly generated at the network edge by Internet of Things (IoT) devices and sensors. Bringing the sensed data from the edge of a distributed network to a centralized cloud is often infeasible because of the massive data volume, limited network bandwidth, and real-time application constraints. Consequently, there is a desire to push AI frontiers to the network edge toward utilizing the enormous amount of data generated by IoT devices near the data source. The merger of edge computing and AI has engendered a new discipline, that is, AI at the edge or edge intelligence. To help AI make sense of gigantic data at the network edge, data fusion is of paramount significance and goes hand in hand with AI. This article focuses on data fusion and AI at the edge. In this article, we propose a framework for data fusion and AI processing at the edge. We then provide a comparative discussion of different data fusion and AI models and architectures. We discuss multiple levels of fusion and different types of AI, and how different types of AI align with different levels of fusion. We then highlight the benefits of combining data fusion with AI at the edge. The methods of AI and data fusion at the edge detailed in this article are applicable to many application domains including aerospace systems. We evaluate the effectiveness of combined data fusion and AI at the edge using convolutional neural network models and multiple hardware platforms suitable for edge computing. Experimental results reveal that combining AI with data fusion can impart a speedup of 9.8× while reducing energy consumption up to 88.5\% over AI without data fusion. Furthermore, results demonstrate that data fusion either maintains or improves the accuracy of AI in most cases. For our experiments, data fusion imparts a maximum improvement of 15.8\% in accuracy to AI.},

	abstract = {Smart city services, smart applications and smart devices form an ecosystem of tools and artifacts that challenge, and times even disrupt, conventions, norms, and rites of behavior, thus prompting diverse behavioral changes at the level of the individual, the group, and the society at large. In this view, smart city may be viewed as a – one of its kind – laboratory to query the complex human-computer relationship from a multi-dimensional perspective. By adopting this perspective, this paper queries the existing smart city surveillance systems to identify their key limitations and sources of frequently justified controversies. It is argued that to bypass these – first – the value of mesh-technology should be explored. It is also argued that – second – it is necessary not only to bring citizens back in the discussion on smart city, but also to highlight the mechanisms by means of which they might be involved in the co-design of smart city solutions and in urban decision-making. To bridge these two imperatives, smart city is conceptualized as a smart service system and, consequently, a wireless integrated mesh-technology enhanced (WIMTE) smart city surveillance system is elaborated.},

	abstract = {In the last two decades, closed-circuit television (CCTV) surveillance cameras have come to occupy a central role in contemporary crime prevention across the world. Widely viewed as the “internationalization” of CCTV surveillance, there has been a corresponding growth in the evidence base about its effect on crime. The cumulative evidence demonstrates that CCTV surveillance is associated with significant yet modest reductions in crime and the effects vary across a range of contextual factors, including country of origin. This paper reports on the global expansion of CCTV schemes and examines –using systematic review methods with meta-analytic techniques – effects of CCTV schemes on crime in different countries. It draws upon a recently updated database of CCTV evaluations (N = 162) covering nearly five decades of research and spanning the globe, which now includes many industrialised countries. Implications for policy and research are discussed, with a special emphasis on emerging surveillance technologies.},

	abstract = {An open research question has been whether a single human can supervise a true heterogeneous swarm of robots completing tasks in real-world environments. A general concern is whether or not the human’s workload will be taxed to the breaking point. The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency’s OFFensive Swarm-Enabled Tactics (OFFSET) program’s ﬁeld exercises that occurred at U.S. Army urban training sites provided the opportunity to understand the impact of achieving such swarm deployments. The Command and Control of Aggregate Swarm Tactics integrator team’s swarm commander uses the heterogeneous robot swarm to conduct relevant missions. During the ﬁnal OFFSET program ﬁeld exercise, the team collected objective and subjective metrics related to the swarm commander’s human performance. A multidimensional workload algorithm that estimates the overall workload based on ﬁve components of workload was used to analyze the results. While the swarm commander’s workload estimates did cross the overload threshold frequently, the swarm commander was able to successfully complete the missions, often under challenging operational conditions. The presented results demonstrate that a single human can deploy a swarm of 100 heterogeneous robots to conduct real-world missions.},

To address these crimes, police of the future need to evolve as well and data will be at the center stage of this evolution. In this contribution we are proposing a data centric policing proposal for smart cities.
