\chapter{Work Plan}

The research project will be conducted over a 4-year-period with 75\% project work and 25\% other tasks at Kongsberg Defence and Aerospace (KDA). During this period, the candidate will be freed from current work duties at KDA to engage with research and development activities. The candidate’s role within the company during the PhD project will involve further establishing the KDA AI initiative as well as being a flexible resource for other projects related to the research. The project period is planned from January 2025 until December 2028.
