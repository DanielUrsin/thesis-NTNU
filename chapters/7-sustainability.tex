\chapter{Sustainability}

The aims of this research project are aligned with multiple of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDG). As mentioned in section 2.2, the main goal of this project is to augment the effectiveness of law enforcement and other emergency handling organizations, which is in agreement with SDG 11: “Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable”. In addition, by being partly funded by Forskningsrådet through the industry PhD scheme, the project is in strong agreement with SG9: “Build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation” as it fosters innovation as well as cooperation between industrial and academic institutions. Finally, the project is well-aligned with SDG 16: “Promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice for all and build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels”. Tools and understandings developed though this research could strengthen both our emergency handling potential as well as our national total-defense capabilities.
