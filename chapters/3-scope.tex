\chapter{Scope}

As stated in section 2, the PhD project will focus on and experiment on novel information handling methods in complex and data rich environments for supporting digitalized and federated situational awareness (SA). Artificial intelligence and machine learning will play important roles in this research, although mainly from a utilitarian viewpoint. This project will focus on the usage of existing AI/ML solutions and investigate how these technologies should be accommodated in the proposed SA frameworks.
